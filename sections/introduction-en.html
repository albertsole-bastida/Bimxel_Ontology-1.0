<span class="markdown">The BIMxel ontology bridges the gap between BIM data (particularly IFC) and sustainability analysis. It provides a shared vocabulary for describing building components, systems, materials, and performance indicators, supporting consistent interpretation and reuse of data across design, construction, and operation stages.
By mapping IFC elements to semantic classes, BIMXEL integrates quantitative semantics from QUDT, observational structures from SOSA, and temporal representations from the TIME ontology. This combination enables rich queries, data integration, and automated reasoning about building performance, energy consumption, and environmental impact.</span>
