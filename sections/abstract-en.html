<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
"The BIMXEL ontology provides a semantic framework for representing and analyzing information from Building Information Models (BIM), specifically IFC files, with a focus on sustainability and resource efficiency in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) domain.
It enables the extraction, structuring, and enrichment of building data related to materials, systems, energy, water consumption, and COâ‚‚ emissions.
Through semantic mappings between IFC entities and ontology classes, BIMXEL supports environmental performance analysis, scenario simulation, and decision-making processes aimed at improving energy efficiency, water use, and carbon footprint across the building life cycle."
